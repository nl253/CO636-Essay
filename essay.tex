\title{Applications of Evolutionary Algorithms in Scheduling}

\begin{document}

% TODO fix diveev2017 citation

\maketitle

Optimal scheduling has been classed as NP-hard \cite[p.~26]{aljarrah2017}
\cite[p.~52]{diveev2017} \cite[p.~92]{mesghouni2004}.  To find a
satisfactory solution we must resort to non-standard approaches such
as Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). EAs are often employed when dealing
with multi-dimensional combinatorial optimization problems with a large
search space, such as this one, where sampling of every candidate is not
possible \cite[p.~29]{floreano2008} \cite[p.~53]{diveev2017}.  EAs are
a good choice in such scenarios because they allow to find good-enough
solution to problems that don't necessarily need an \emph{optimal}
solution\cite[p.~44]{heaton2014} \cite[p.~53]{diveev2017}.  They also
present an opportunity to exploit the computing power of modern multi-core
CPUs by running subroutines in parallel. \cite[p.~28]{aljarrah2017}
This essay will attempt to explore ways of applying a GA to solve
scheduling problems.

\section*{The Problem}

\emph{Scheduling} in this essay will refer to ordering of tasks that aims to maximise the
productivity whilst adhering to the constraints that an organisation
may impose.  The ordering may schedule some activities to take place in
parallel if business rules and the amount of resources allow for that.
Efficient scheduling of tasks if of interests to anyone who wishes to
increase their productivity \emph{without} investing additional resources.

Scheduling for an organisation is often associated with adhering to a
set of constraints that must be met called \emph{hard constraints} in
the literature, such as: lecturers can only give one lecture at a time
but there are also \emph{soft constraints} which benefit candidates that
adhere to them but are not compulsory e.g. the timetable includes breaks
in between activities to allow for rest. \cite[p.~26]{aljarrah2017}
\cite{timilsina2015} \cite[p.~2505]{qaurooni2013}

\section*{Solving the Problem}

Applying an EA entails the use of 3 main components: a selection
operator \footnote{to remove the unfit candidates and persist the
fittest}, genetic operator \footnote{to create new candidate solutions}
and a fitness function \footnote{to identify the fittest candidates}
\cite{mesghouni2004, yu2002, diveev2017, aljarrah2017, timilsina2015}.

\subsection*{Encoding Candidates}

% TODO what tends to be used
% TODO issues with the current approach (if applicable) or why the current approach is good
% TODO conclude suggesting best encoding 

In GAs candidates are most commonly encoded using bitstrings
\cite[p.~127]{norvig2010} and they have received the most attention in
the literature \cite[p.~103]{eberhart2007}. However, it is not certain
that this is the most natural, the most convenient or the most efficient encoding
for the scheduling problem. The standard bit-string encoding has been
criticised by Mesghouni et al. who say "this approach cannot usually
be used for real word engineering problems such as combinatorial ones"
\cite[p.~93]{mesghouni2004}. Instead they suggest the use of numbers for
representing every gene so that each candidate is a permutation of numbers.
Researchers who wish to abandon the traditional approach might need to
invent new operators or adapt existing ones to fit their encoding scheme which
may be seen as a disadvantage. 

% It's also important to bear in mind that although bitstrings 
% may \emph{seem} to be easy to manipulate in modern programming langauges, 
% not many runtimes support bitstrings. None of the most popular languages: Java,
% Python, JavaScript support the notion of a bitstring. Of those only Python supports integers with arbitrary size which may be used to emulate a bitstring. 

\subsection*{Selection Operator}

% TODO what operator tends to be used
% TODO issues with the current approach (if applicable) or why the current approach is good
% TODO conclude suggesting best operators

Selection is the core of every genetic algorithm. A good selection scheme
ensures the algorithm does not converge prematurely on a sub-optimal
solution because the selection pressure was too high (and the diversity was
lost prematurely \cite[p.~23]{floreano2008}) and at the same
time does not let the procedure run for too long. \cite{yu2002}

The GA literature discusses a number of operators to be used for
selection: proportionate \footnote{roulette wheel}, rank-based and
tournament among others \cite{floreano2008, eberhart2007, heaton2014}.

A popular choice seems to be proportionate selection with
many researchers discussing and implementing GAs with this
scheme. \cite{timilsina2015, yu2002, aljarrah2017, mesghouni2004}
Al-Jarrah et al. reported excellent results when using proportionate
selection scheme with instructors rating the output timetable as \(9.56/10\).

However a good choice of selection operator could also be rank-based
selection (RBS).  RBS avoids issues that proportionate selection faces:
when all candidates have a similar fitness or one candidate has a
large high fitness score, the selection turns into a random search.
\cite[p.~23]{floreano2008}. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be
much research that wishes to test this hypothesis and see if it would
yield better results.

Furthermore, there are reasons to believe that tournament selection would
also be beneficial.  Since each tournament is run on a number of distinct
individuals, each one of those tournaments can be run independently
meaning we can execute them in parallel. This might address the issue
of poor performance. 

\subsection*{Genetic Operators}

In terms of genetic operators research into GAs and scheduling seems
to rely mainly on crossover and mutation \cite{yu2002, aljarrah2017,
mesghouni2004, hosseinabadi2018, solanki2015, timilsina2015, may2015}.
The aim of selection operators is to reduce the size of the population. To
replenish it, winners are used as input to genetic operators which create
new individuals.  Crossover is commonly used because it is a standard and
well-understood operator. Additionally, mutation with a small probability
tends to be introduced to further increase variation in the population.
These two tend to be combined because cross-over \emph{recombines}
existing genes whereas mutation introduces \emph{novelty}.
\cite[p.~27]{heaton2014}.  A good starting values for the parameters would
be as follows: \(p(crossover) = 0.8\) \cite[p.~117]{eberhart2007} and
\(p(mutation) = 0.2\) \cite[p.~25]{heaton2014} although some researchers
suggest much lower rates e.g. \(0.005\) \cite[p.~117]{eberhart2007}.

However, the use of the standard operators has been criticised in
timetabling problems.  By looking at a single candidate (mutation) or a
pair (cross-over) we are risking crating an invalid candidate that breaks
hard constraints. We might, for instance, schedule a student to be in two
places at the same time \emph{unless} we take a different approach and
when generating candidates consider the candidates that have been created
so far. \cite[p.~2506]{qaurooni2013}.  This may save us from the danger
of generating pointless candidates but may come at a cost. Firstly,
the complexity of the algorithm increases.  Many are compelled to
use GAs \emph{because} they are simple.  Secondly, in this scheme we
would need to iterate through the set of crated candidates every time a
genetic operator is applied and carry out (potentially expensive) checks.
Further research needs to be done to determine if alternative operators
should be preferred. It might be that group-based operators save time but
also waste time on performing all the checks for meeting hard-constraints.

\subsection*{Fitness Function}

The fitness function (FF) is problem-specific. Therefore, it is difficult
to give any specific guidelines with regard to how it should be
computed. Along with the parameters such as initial population size the
FF is one of the main concerns programmers face when using
genetic algorithms. In essence, FF measures to what
extent a candidate solution obeys the soft and hard constraints.

% There is likely many good-enough solutions to the problem i.e. many
% timetables could satisfy the constraints listed above. In other words,
% the fitness landscape has many peaks.



\subsection*{The invariant}

% TODO what tends to be the ending criterion
% TODO issues with the current approach (if applicable) or why the current approach is good
% TODO conclude suggesting best invariant (timeout)

GA is run repeated until either enough time has passed or other condition
has been met. \cite[p.~108]{eberhart2007}. In this scenario a good choice
would be to wait for a high enough fitness value in a candidate but to
also introduce a timeout of, say, 10 minutes in case such a candidate
cannot be found.

\subsection*{Initial Population}

The initial population tends to be randomly generated
\cite[p.~97]{mesghouni2004} \cite[p.~29]{aljarrah2017}.  
A good size of population that researchers are using appears to be
\(>=100\) \cite[p.~101]{mesghouni2004} \cite[p.~16]{timilsina2015}
\cite{hosseinabadi2018}.

Yu Enzhe and Sung Kiseok, for instance, run their GA to solve
a timetabling problem using population sizes of \(25\), \(50\) and
\(100\) and received the best results with \(100\). \cite[p.~715]{yu2002}
However, it's also important to bear in mind that GAs are used typically
in very complex problems and each candidate might encode for hundreds
of variables. Assuming that a candidate codes for \(300\) variables and
every variable requires \(32\) bits of memory (enough to represent values
from \(0\) to \(4294967296\)) we end up with each candidate having a
size of \(300 * 32 bits = 9600\ bits = 1200\ Bytes = 1.2\ KB\).  So it
might not be able to raise the population size to an arbitrary size.

% population would be to use elitism. This would protect against degrading
% of solutions when cross-over is applied to fittest candidates.
% \cite[p.~26]{floreano2008}

% However, this enhancement may not be necessary. Norvig
% \cite[p.~128]{norvig2010} points out that when the algorithm begins to
% converge on a solution after being run for a while, the candidates in
% our population are not very diverse. This means, in theory, that the
% cross-over operator would take "smaller steps" because of how similar
% candidates are.

\section*{Conclusion}

This essay demonstrated how EA can be applied to scheduling.  It
discussed the practices of the research community including: encoding,
initial population, genetic \& selection operators and parameter values.
